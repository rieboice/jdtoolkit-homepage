   I am currently working and living in Sun Valley, Idaho where I grew up! This is the view from my walk with Hollis, a friend's dog I was taking care of!

   Here are some photos I edited - some for clarity and some for fun!
 </p> </h5>

    <h5>  <p> This is a photo I took of the valley where I live from the top of the ski mountain while skiing yesterday, a photo of my boyfriend, Tanner, when we rode the gondola to the lodge on the mountain for Valentines day, and a close up of the snow bank outside my house.  </p></h5>  
 <img src="RIEBOICE-exposure-before.jpg" width="450" height="350"> <!-- This is how to change the dimensions of your photo -->
     <img src="RIEBOICE-exposure-after.jpg" width="450" height="350">
         <h5> <p> This is a photo from my neighborhood where I selected the snow on my phone when taking the photo to make the exposure adjust too bright. I lowered the brightness and adjusted the contrast in Photoshop to make it more "readable."  </p> </h5> 
      <img src="RIEBOICE-low-exposure-before.jpg" width="300" height="366">
        <img src="RIEBOICE-low-exposure-after.jpg" width="300" height="366">
           <h5>  <p> This is a photo from my neighborhood where I selected a shadow on my phone when taking the photo to make the exposure adjust too low. I brightened it in Photoshop to make it more "readable."  </p> </h5> 
          <img src="RIEBOICE-group-jd-logo.jpg" width="800" height="450">
             <h5>  <p> This is a photo I took when we hiked the ski mountain in the moonlight a few nights ago.  </p> </h5> 
            <img src="RIEBOICE-valentine-edit.jpg" width="400" height="534" >
              <h5>   <p> I love the color pink, and it fit because this photo was taken on a Valentine's day date. I utilized a photo I took of the ski mountain (where we took the gondola), and the circle tool, combined with the background eraser and paint tool to create a fun night-timeish background.  </p> </h5>

  Tanner used to ski for the US Ski Team, so here is my favorite of his crash videos for your viewing pleasure.
