   I am currently working and living in Sun Valley, Idaho where I grew up! This is the view from my walk with Hollis, a friend's dog I was taking care of!
   
   This assignment is meant to familiarize us with manipulating photographs so we can make them work for us in whatever context we need them to - including for this website!

        <p> This is a photo from my neighborhood where I selected the snow on my phone when taking the photo to make the exposure adjust too bright. I lowered the brightness and adjusted the contrast in Photoshop to make it more "readable."  </p>

        <img src="RIEBOICE-low-exposure-after.jpg" width="200" height="266">
           <p> This is a photo from my neighborhood where I selected a shadow on my phone when taking the photo to make the exposure adjust too low. I brightened it in Photoshop to make it more "readable."  </p>
          <img src="RIEBOICE-group-jd-logo.jpg" width="400" height="225">
             <p> This is a photo I took when we hiked the ski mountain in the moonlight a few nights ago.  </p>
           <img src="RIEBOICE-banner.jpg" width="600" height="202">
              <p> This is a photo I took of the valley where I live from the top of the ski mountain while skiing yesterday, a photo of my boyfriend, Tanner, when we rode the gondola to the lodge on the mountain for Valentines day, and a close up of the snow bank outside my house.  </p>
            <img src="RIEBOICE-valentine-edit.jpg" width="400" height="534">
               <p> I love the color pink, and it fit because this photo was taken on a Valentine's day date. I utilized a photo I took of the ski mountain (where we took the gondola), and the circle tool, combined with the background eraser and paint tool to create a fun night-timeish background.  </p>
